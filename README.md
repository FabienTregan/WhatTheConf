# WhatTheConf
Not really a conf.

## What ?

A gathering of people who want to present talks about beauty or fun they find in tech, really not caring weither it has any use in their daily paid job.

## Why ?

Because many conferences tend to focus on trendy and usefull subjects, when the most interesting things are discussed at restaurant in the evening

## Where ?

Probably in southern France, less than one hour driving from Toulouse. 

## When ?

End of Spring or start of Summer. June 15-16 2018 might be fine.

## Who ?

Don't know.
Probably not too much people.
I hope to have beginner speakers and will try to find way to help them propose for first time (ideas : present in team, provide support to write / prepare the talk, have no public question after the talk so you can propose about a subject without being an expert. Any other idea ? tell me (@ftregan / fabien at tregan dot fr )

## Star speakers

I might consider anyone who bring the best cookies our star speaker. This conf is not about star speakers. But I like cookies.

## Agenda

I'd like the talks to be choosed not by the organisation team but by attendees. Here are some talks I wish would be proposed :

*#* Story of computers from the Loom to the Eniac
*#* Wooden Pneumatic Logic Gates : making a bloons based calculator
*#* Pong game made from Minecraft blocks and redstone
*#* The 12 pieces of wood which make a guitar
*#* Bourbakism and modern math teaching

## Price

Without sponsors, the registration fee could go from 0 to 50â‚¬ depending the place we rent (or don't) and weither ti's bring-your-own-food or not.
